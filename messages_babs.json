Please keep in mind that often I tend to be quite impulsive and I was in a very negative mindset when I sent them to you.\nI also did mention right away to sort of scratch out what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d said and was trying to express the frustration that I feel with out situation.\nAnd most importantly, I believe it is ridiculous that you would automatically assume that it has to do with \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecisions that you have made\u00e2\u0080\u009d or that it is in any way there is blame that just be assigned to one side or the other/// Life has brought you where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brought you and life has brought me where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brought me; it is not in our power to decide what we are doing in order to bring ourselves at the height of our personal aspirations because that is what this is. It seems perfectly logical and simultaneously absurd to think that if we wish for our presence to be constant in each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives that we should veer our paths towards each other and I think that our relationship never entailed that; we always happened to live in the same city for a while and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re near to each other regardless of our personal decision making. I explain al of this to try and get out of your silly head that somehow the reason why we are separate at the moment has to do with decisions that you have made yourself. We are both still learning and we are both still attempting to mould things in our lives to understand better how to navigate them in the directions we wish to do so. \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strange deadlock and it is one free of responsibility; it just happened, as it would and we both find ourselves in it. \n\nThat is why I think we should seek to spend time together this summer again and for a longer period of time; and enjoy it fully for what it is. So much time has passed since we have taken part in each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives quotidian that sometimes I wonder if the magic of our relationship would flake slightly if it actually happened in the moment we forced it. So I will bring myself back to the mystical seed of our connection and say that yes, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make an effort to see each other soon, savour it and stop the desire or imaginations that we have of what it would be like if we were to be in the same city and let the hunger rise again in another moment in which I believe we will be able to make more concrete decisions to bring us to being in the same place at the same time. \n\nAm I making sense?\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to be able to disentangle you from the self-deprecation that sometimes you express and feel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Please free yourself of responsibilities that you have claimed as your own\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how many times I will express this. \n\nI am glad that you have decided to stop your job. You have, indeed, been repeating for far too long the fatigue with which you execute it, and with a little bit more experience under my belt I feel that I can now say to you that if you have stopped learning and have stopped enjoying what you are doing then fucking change things and do what you felt and feel like you need to do. But actually do it. \nMaybe you needed to bring yourself to these limits in order to understand this, or to bring yourself to finally do what genuinely fills you, inspires you and makes you happy. Try to browse through your history and remember the times at which you have peaked in your positive frame of mind and know that you have the instruments already to veer yourself towards that frame of mind again. The last time I saw you there was a layer of strength, confidence and security that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there before and I know that you have the strength and verve to enhance it even more.",

And it makes it easy to imagine you with short hair, and makes me think what I have always thought and believe I have told you before, which is that you would look very good with short hair :)\n\nI like looking at this picture. It makes me happy and warm and it feels very real somehow. It's warm. Fills my heart.\n\nI also like that you've been hanging out with Robi, because I liked her a lot (wow i like many things)... even though you said she ahs her defects, but everybody has their defect.\nIt's funny what you said about having a female presence because all of my best friends are women (or guys who are gay).\nI love women, what can i say ;)\n\nI like that you've been listening to Tulipa Ruiz. <3\nI am still listening to Little Joy a lot and it very often takes me back to Roman days with you...\nAnd I have been very much into older Brazilian music which I am only now discovering because I didn't grow up here so I don't know a lot of the 'classics'\nThis is one of them, which I have been obsessively listening to:\nGilberto Gil - Toda Menina Baiana\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgQLOSpG4EM\n(listen at least until 1:22)\nA, a, a, a que Deus deu!

(look at the still shots at the very end)\nwell, the gayness of it obviously.\nand mainly and most importantly, his voice enters your ribcage and rattles it if you let it.\n\nokay i am done with that, sorry.\nit's not even that great a video. but it's very good.\n\nI came to S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo on Friday.\nSaturday was a friend's birthday party and Milly, the girl I was sort of seeing before travelling went and we hung out and it was nice. it was a very long sort of thing as it started early afternoon and we were there until 2AM singing songs, she was playing guitar.\nthen we went to her house and hung out in front of it and in the bar next door and we talked until 5 in the morning and i found myself telling a lot of stories i wouldn't normally tell someone that doesn't know me very well. it was very nice. i like her a little a lot i think. i don't know which of the two, but whichever one is nice.\ni will tell you more about it when we skype. because i have just realised we are about to have a skype call and i will talk about the same things i was going to write here... mmm.\n\nwell that's just the most recent thing on my mind. but there's all of my time in Rio which i need to talk to you about because there were some interesting bits and things. \nand there is the now which i need to talk to you about because i am more undecided than ever. i haven't got one fucking clue. i do not understand my life and me and my mind and my desires and needs and dreams and 'goals' and nothing. i don't know any of it.\n\nI am looking forward to our conversation and I wish you could be here to hang out with me on the lovely terrace of this apartment and explore S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo with me because it is an amazingly intricate and infinitely interesting city and it is so alive it's enthralling and thrilling and bodily-exciting.\n\nI love you I love you I love you and I could say it ad infinitum.

I just couldn't find the right way to express it. I still don't have it. \n\nHow in the world did you find that post?! haha I had no memory of it. \nBut I hug you back https://external-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDHEdpmuhbhTLkR&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tumblr.com%2Ftumblr_m7c3l8TL0P1rqkf12.gif&ext=gif :) <3\n\nI love you I do I love you I do.\nAnd I have been breathing and living you. Thank you so much for your words. They have filled me with love and life and light and warmth. Thank you for writing to me even in my absence. \nI don't want to say sorry because you told me not to but I do wish that I could because I do. feel... that.\n\nBut fuck. Lately I have been obsessed with an idea that I cannot write speak see or generally feel the same way that I did in some past that's behind me and that I cannot get back to.\nAnd that's why I didn't reply to you for such a lont time (this time did include varuiys failed attempts)\n\nBut then I serendipitously came across another Cummings poem, \n\n\"since feeling is first\nwho pays any attention\nto the syntax of things\nwill never wholly kiss you;\"\n\nWhich basically just told me to shut up and stop thinking about the hows and correct whens and whys and just write to you because feeling is first. And so here I am writing to you. The feeling of wanting to write to you, to let you know that you are with me, that I live breathe feel you all the time, was becoming unbearable (but I could find the right words, so I could not speak)\nI'm sorry I can't be more sound, more present, more coherent, concrete, stable and eventually you're going to get sick of this and that scares me. But no matter to that, I will stop giving voice to these thoughts I will, I'm sorry. (I cannot stop with the sorry, it's unmutable).\n\nIt was so lovely to read about you, please do not stop doing that. I am in a similar place where I really need to focus and figure out what to do next (professionally). But I really don'y want to so it's been hard. I want a life of books and writing and films and travelling and I think I have told you this and its ridiculous I know.\nRight at thsi moment, I don't want to make films. I don't even want to be involved in it. I just want to take it. It's very much like the fact that I don't want to speak, I just want to listen. I don't want to write to you, I just want to read you. I'm not sure what this means yet but I know that in at least one way, it isn't good at all. It is passive. And passive is not good. \nLife is creation. And creation is action. But then action can so easily become DO DO DO, which I cannot deal with. DO DO DO feels like an avalanche swallowing me up, a mountain crumbling on top of me. \nBut I also know there is a big misconception in that rational link (like in most of the rational links I make in my head), I just need to break it and not see in that way.\nPoint is, I can't (or don't want to) DO DO DO.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking group. I canot find their email Mainly because my email search engine isn't working well. But this is just since yesterday, so I will try again later with a different internet connectio (I am on a ridiculously slow internet connection). I wil also try to find through my phone and as soon as I have it I will send it to you. It might be right after I send you this message.\n\nBut the bad thing is that I wanted to send an email connecting you with someone there, but the girl that I knew isn't there anymore I think (then thre was just the owner of the whole thing who I didn't know very well, and the filmmakers were all freelancers that came and went). But I will try still. \n\nI need to go now because I am meeting my uncle and aunt for lunch and I am running late. But I will write to you again soon, very soon (today still, maybe, I hope). About all the other things I did not write about now (everything, basically). \n\nPlease don't reply to this because I feel like I am on a very delicate thread of being able to write and I fear that maybe if you write, it will break my thread and I will get back to thinking that I cannot write to you because I cannot find the right words to express all of the things that I feel which are bigger than me and the universe and which put language to shame because words cannot scrape the thinnest surface of everything that is contained within me in relation to your existence.\n\nSpeak to you in a little bit.\nI love(life light universe everything and so much that I cannot comprehend) you.",

I don't want to talk about it all but instead, I found a piece of paper on which I wrote some anxious thoughts a few months ago, and I it still resonates and I am going to copy it out o you because \n1. I think it might help me understand myself a little\n2. you will understand how I generally feel about life at this point.\nIt was very relieving to find this piece of paper because I haven't been able to formulate opinions, logical thoughts about anything. So, this did it. So that's why I think copying it out might even be some sort of therapy - get my mind to itself.\n\nThis is it:\n\nSometimes I think I want to go to some sort of psych institution. Like I want to give up. But I don't.\nAnd the clock is ticking and I'm 24 years old - how old was Winona's character in Girl, Interrupted?\nSometimes I think I'm never going to learn how to live in this world. I keep making the stupidest mistakes. There's practical things about practical life that I just don't understand. I thought that as I grew I would just grow into things. I would just grow into life, but it hasn't happened. \nAnd will I? And what am I supposed to do while I don't? And do I want to?\nI don't think I do (want to grow into practical life)! But it would be so much easier if I did!\nAnd yet as soon as I feel myself slipping into the steps of modern adult life I panic. I panic because I don't, I don't want to be part of this society - the one I was born into and find myself in right now - modern upper-middle-class.\nAnd I fucking hate that part of me tells me I'm spoiled (feels spoiled) as I say this. Because that's the voice of the upper middle-class in me trying to say I'm ungrateful. I hate that fucking voice. (Now, this is not about money or status in society - I am talking about a whole mindset and way of living).\nI hate this world around me.\nI hate modern apartment buildings (stacked lives) and banks and talks about eh next car they want to buy. What the fuck is building credit at a bank? And now all of a sudden I need to start caring about it - BUT I DONT!!!\nIntrinsically I don't, but am forced to care. I am forced to play. I am forced to think up a strategy. And I'm always gonna suck at this game because how good can one be at a game they don't like and don't care about? I only half-heartedly listen to the rules. \nI don't like any of the options given to me.\nI don't like any of the characters I have been given to choose as my player in the game.\nAnd then the dice is too heavy so I can't throw it.\nI have made my own Frankenstein monster character to play the game, but it's like all the pieces I took from all the other characters are all of the weakest, most useless ones. My character does nothing in this game.

I believe I have told you this many times.\n\nSo I hope that today you celebrated the beautiful being that is you. And life! And you! And life! And love!\n\nI wish you love. So much love! Always! In all its shapes and forms!\nAnd light. light light light.\nGod but you are all these things! Life and love and light!\n\nI love you.\nNow, always...\nLight of mine",

      "content": "It's lovely to hear your words in my head once again.\nGod I miss you. I think I about you everyday, one way or another.\nStill carry you in my heart.\n\nI am living in a world that is so so surreal. I don't believe I am in it. It's a reality so disconnected from my previous reality that I can never actually believe it's real. And it never ever stops feeling temporary. I don't know if that means that I'm in the wrong place, that I don't want to stay, or if it just means that I know it's temporary.\n\nI am shooting in the Brazilian countryside. In a gigantic farm from the 19th century, that used to have hundreds of slaves (the series takes place in the slavery period of Brazil). It's awe-filling. It's beautiful and tragic and sad at the same time. \n\nI'm working with a director that took me under his wing as his pupil, basically. He is teaching me so much. He is kind but hard at the same time. Not approachable at all unless he invites me in, which he does at specific times. He confides in me and I in him and it's refreshing and soothing and calming because I can be honest and he know that I'm not sure about anything. And he understands. But he still demands a lot of me, because he says while I'm there I have to be the best and I could be great.\nI don't know.\nIt's weird. I have taken a gigantic step from the last job (I have been given all of the hardest shoots to do, together with this director, who is the main director - he chose me! i don't know why, how) ...and now all of a sudden I have been given so much responsibility and while I'm scared and think I can't do it people say I can and so I keep going and then people say I'm great.\nI don't think I'm great. That's probably because I know that I don't know anything. That I don't even think I should be there! That I'm not sure about anything. But I don't know what to do.\nFor now I keep going.\nI'm learning, I'm moving, I'm trying to understand... and I guess someday I'll get to where I'm going.\n\nIt's been weird on this job.\nWithin the space of 1 week, 2 of the guys who are in someways my 'bosses' tried to kiss me. Both of them married. \nOne of them I would so certainly fall in love with, which was kind of happening until we kissed... But he's married and with kids and so there is nothing more to be said or done. He's one of the most intelligent and most interesting people I know. And there's an energy that is almost impossible to control that flows between us... but nothing more can be said or done.\nAnd then now the production coordinator is -his words- falling in love with me. So it's actually become kind of annoying now because I just want people to stop mixing things up. Now I have to deal with this guy on a daily basis and he started treating me badly because I don't reciprocate his feelings... He had to apologise to me this week because of how bad it had gotten. \nAnd it's all so far from what love is.\n\nI'm trying to think of how I could show you my reality and share this surreal world I am living in and I think the solution is to send you photos. Because I could not express in words. So I think that's what I\"m gonna start doing. I don't even know if the number that I have is your number anymore? How crazy is that??\nBasically. Everyday I put a pair of Timberland boots because we shoot in forests and lakes and beautiful middles of nowhere. I get bitten by millions of insects. I deal with and coordinate a lot of people who always have a lot of questions that I have to answer with great certainty (though I have none).\nWe've become like a family which is nice. Together all day, everyday.\nAnd... I'm under constant stress that any of my answers or decisions is wrong and so I worry a lot in my life.\nI dislike this level of responsibility profoundly.\n\nDo you feel how stilted, how stiff my speaking has become?\n\nI'm scared that I have changed so much. Though I don't feel I have. I'm scared that if we talk, that if I let you see me again, then you will realise that. And I don't know what that would mean. I'm scared of what that might mean. I know you don't want to talk about how things are between us, but I'm telling you this so that you know in all honesty how I feel, most truly. I think that's the only way I know how to communicate with you.\n\nI love you always. Always.\nOne certainty amidst all of the uncertainties!",

This year's been strange\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The last few months- a lot of anxiety, strange feelings, heavy winter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Essay writing period was absolutely fucking insane man\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Eating tuna sandwiches and taking speed for fifteen days in a row and consequently suffering violent comedown and insomnia after I had finished (lol)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thinking 'what the fuck am I supposed to do now?' - really- \"who am I?\" and \"am I going to now become insane because of this unknown void awaiting me of potential and multiple possibilities?\"  So yes- my body and mind feel at rest. \nI went to my friend's mom's house near Sperlonga where they are doing a sort of permaculture community project- soaked sun, slept a lot, ate like a king and smoked millions of joints with the mother of this friend of mine, who is a hard ass ex-feminist sixty year old who smokes cigarettes and joints from morning to evening and is one of the smartest, most foul-mouthed women I have ever met\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On top of the two of them joking around in heavy roman accents- bestemmia ogni due parole- \nOnly stayed for two days and the rest of my time in Rome, seeing a few people and taking care of stupid shit like my license\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but the point is it's been a good break from the sort of grey and black whirlpool of guck and glitter that London was becoming in my head.\nI have started seeing a boy called Matteo whose been taking up most of my time in the past few months, whose a very laid back character similar to a child (who also smokes millions of joints\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the universe wants me to be a stoner man, not I)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We'd been friends for a long time and have unexpectedly created a very strange affection for each other and things are quite 'serious'? It was a bit unpleasant in the beginning on my part because I was dismissing the possibility of wanting to be in a \"relationship\" with someone (if you know what I mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?) and sort of blocking energies that were just naturally flowing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. But now, it's really \u00e2\u0080\u00a6nice and warm- this is the best way to explain it. I am happy.\n\nBut on the other hand\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.fucking confused but in other contexts- I don't know what i want to do and this was causing me a lot of stress but now I have just come to the conclusion that I have to try a few things out after having gone on vacation a bit in july and beginning of august like internships and such\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 placements\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I don't know anything. I am going to check out stuff in Berlin too because I really wouldn't mind living there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even though the winter fuckin' worries me. That's also why I have started this strangely stable lifestyle lately- my immune system is fucked and if I ever want to live in the winter again without going ill at least nine times I have to patch that up somehow. :)\n\nI've thought of you in various moments in the past few months- moments of solitude, moments of music, moments of wind, moments in museums and especially in various streets which we've walked on together. \n\nThis strange silence between us was maddening me (not directed at you but at the situation), but I have sort of accepted it somehow- as part of the \"everything\"\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 because I believe it is temporary. I still believe that. I thought of you while I looked at what you wrote on my wall. Babs, I still carry your heart. I feel it. I'm smiling.\nBut yes, I would like it if you wrote back and if we talked on Skype without the pressure of needing to talk about our situation but rather, speak as if we were having a conversation walking in a street in Trastevere\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and hand't seen each other in while. I thought of you when I went to portese as well. \nI won't dare re-read what I wrote. AS per, I am very stoned and got serious about it but now I have sort of fallen into a ramble and am terrified that the auto spell on this computer has fucked with my diction.\n\nThere are so many more things that could be said but here's my window open\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. yo.\n\n\nI love you.

I don't know if I ever spoke to you about contact dance but if you don't know what it is, maybe you should look it up but basically it's about sharing your energy core with someone through movement-- you share your weight and nobody leads the dance... The workshop I go to is more of an experimental creative gathering of sorts... The session lasts two hours and by the end of the first one I went there were people rolling on the floor in unison and on top of each other, people emitting ridiculous sounds and others playing instruments. There was a huge piece of paper on the floor and some were drawing abstract shapes and such. The last session we ended up in our improvised movement with each other in a circle surrounding a chic who has an enchanting voice and a boy repeating the \"ohm\" lying down on her lap, chanting in unison. \n\nIt's about connection- it's about breaking down barriers and using each other as instruments to channel energies... It's one of the most amazing things I have come about lately... Today I went a photography exhibition in the morning at the photographer's gallery with my friend Pascal. There was sun and it's been rubbish weather for the past days and the cement was radiant. We had lunch that the Hare Krishna people serve near SOAS and fI went shopping in Camden on my own. I bought Frankincense, and then I went to the contact session.\n\nI feel good- my dad came last weekend and we spent two days together- we're on good terms- he was happier with my state of being I think- he says I seem more \"focused\"- this consequentially lead him to be more accepting in a way of things I talked about and ideas that I was sharing with him- curiosity almost. \nI've had really interesting conversations with my various people lately on gender relations, queer theory, meditation, dreams etc. I posed nude for my friend's photo project (bea, do you remember), wearing my red doc martens (which I have cut up) and my aviator goggles in my room. She's done a series of portraits of various people in their rooms, naked-- trying to subvert the normative concept of sexuality and gender in nude photography... I think it's very interesting and I really like the pictures. \n\nI wish to talk to you- I wish I could share things with you every day like this and go to an exhibition and collaborate with you on a project. I miss you so much- I want to know about your every day life- I want to talk about books. \n\nI think of you. I love you. \nNow. I think, forever.",

This does mean that I am definitely not in the right state of mind. The right words definitely will not come. And I am not ever, in this moment, going to even be able to express what goes on in my head in my mind in my body upon contact with you.\n\nWhat you said about getting used to the absence is true. And it's okay. I was a little scared about it at first, but I have come to terms with it. This morning (and this is beautiful, a little bit of sinchronicity still lingering, though were oceans and immesurable spaces of time experience and lives apart) - this morning I too was thinking about how we are roaming through this forest, each on our own trek, opening up our own passage, each discovering something different... and we will meet again and we will come upon a clearing, where we will share and we will exchange our findings. And it will be beautiful. And I can't wait.\nGod I miss you, when I write to you like this. Contact. I feel almost like I'm talking to you through a mirrored mirror. I can only see myself but I know you're on the other side.\nGod I miss you.\n\nI cannot wait to hear about your travels and adventures.\nI am glad they have been positive. Growth and transformation - that's what life is! You beautiful beautiful being! I'm happy because it seems like you are living a life that is whole and pure and true. Meeting people that touch you, that enchant things within you and around you.... \n\nI am travelling and adventuring in a totally different way. Constantly being tested. I'm not sure what this is but I know it is important. I don't know what this will lead to but it is doing something to me. I just need to make sure I keep my head in it's right place, hold tight to my core, not lose sight of the light. Of beauty and magic and life.\nI need to make sure this always builds towards something positive. I'm on an edge I can't fall off of because then I'm scared there's no way back. \nI am atthe same time extremely grateful and extremely scared. I have doubts. But then I'm also filled with complete joy. It's extremely confusing but I am not worrying about it now, I'm just living it as it is, and making soul-filling as I can.\nI will explain all of this to you when we talk.\n\nI think sunday. Can you sunday? If you can, then i will organize my day around it. Make sure it happens under whichever circumstance.\nI need now, to close. Regrettably (there is nothing worse than the feeling of your time being stolen from you. If I could, now, my time would be yours.)\n\nI miss you. I love you.\nAlways.",

      "content": "It's been a long time. Too long. Forgive me for not having written earlier. My mind was filled with so many things and I tried writing once but it was too much of a mess- or I don't know- they weren't the right words. I miss you so. I suppose only now I have gotten used to it or maybe I have lived such a crazy amount of things that the absence wasn't as strong.\n\nMy mind has been taken up by much. Another summer of crazy adventure. Real adventure. Dangerous adventure. Journeying of all kinds I suppose. On emotional levels. On mental & physical levels. Transformation. Evolution. I want to tell you about it- please let's try and speak as soon as possible. Find a corner of time so I can dedicate my entire essence to you! \n\nThere are so many things about myself I think that have become a little more tangible maybe- and some other things that have fallen into perpetual confusion- or not confusion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Simply, there is a lot to work on- a lot to reflect on. But I believe I am at peace with the idea that everything is very unpredictable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 My mind is taken up by so many people and sometimes I worry that there isn't enough space for you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I trust so much, and I am so sure about the fact that we are roaming the same forest and that there is a place where we can go and where maybe we will stay or maybe we will come and go to in the future-that is for us. \n\nIt's sad right now because I feel I have gone on the fringes and I have not the remotest clue about where you are travelling. I'd like to know. \n\nI wonder where you are- what you're doing- what your every day habits are and what position you sleep in. I wonder about what you eat in the morning and what the shoes you wear most often are. \nI miss your hands and your gaze and your laugh. \n\nBut I trust. I carry your heart- I carry it in my heart. \nBabi bella. Dimmi qualcosa- ti chiedo una cosa questa volta. Rispondimi subito. Ti prego. Fallo per me. Stop what you're doing and please write to me because I need you to at least give me a compass, so I know what direction you're in.\n\nI have been to three different festivals and have travelled by hitchhiking and I have met some people that have made bends in my heart and brain and some fucking crazy ones too. I have taken quite an amount of LSD and it is something every individual on earth needs to try\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think I have now taken it enough times that I know this world enough and I want to show it to you. I really do. I want to navigate with you. \nI am now back in Rome and coming to terms with some unresolved emotions I suppose I need to confront with Pap\u00c3\u00a0, Giulietta and my mom. And I am getting ready to fall back into a routine that, at the moment, I think is one I want to try and stray as far away from as possible after university. I need to move- I know this.  (Even though that could change too-- I have only lived this context for the past two months..so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6).\nI have met a boy called Lubomir who I met at Boom and travelled to Rome with. I have never met someone who I share so many parallelisms with in the way that I perceive the world- as well as someone who I physically need around me. This is one of the hardships right now. I don't understand the nature of our relationship entirely but he's important- and I really miss him. \nI am also seeing a series of other people and my polygamy has manifested itself ridiculously this summer. It gets crazy but I have come to terms with it. \nWith this, I close. \n\nI love you. Always. I think forever.",

      "content": "I have written to you on wazzapp that I needed to speak to you- but I can't wait to speak because I'm high on speed and my head has undergone some serious psychadelic treatment, so I am sorry if this doesn't make any sense, or in any case if I am dropping big bombs on you. I don't want to stress you out, more than you seem to be already because of work, your mom, this girl... I really don't- but I love you and you' are what it is that you are to me so I suppose this is why I need to tell you and this is why I feel the need for you to give me feedback on this, to tell me what you think and how you feel. It could bring me back down to somewhere, where things aren't so overwhelming. \n\n\nI have been speaking all day, literally all day- since 12 o clock yesterday morning to 3 o clock in the morning of today, to Matteo about his situation with Sofia. She broke up with him a few weeks ago, and he can't come to terms with why she is giving up on their relationship. We kept going in a loop about things, because I kept trying to convince him that his idea of love is distorted- that it takes two to tango as in, he is the only one willing to make steps to change things, and if she isn't, it means he simply needs to find another person that is and the she isn't to blame either- that there are different interpretations of what love is and it what measures it comes.... He kept saying that when someone really loves someone or something, whatever decision they make will always be on the basis of keeping that thing in your life. \n\nHe kept asking me questions like \"What if Babs said to you that now, in this moment, she wants to be with you and this means you giving up something else that you also want in order to be with her? Would you give it up or would you give up Babs?\"  or telling me that one day I am going to find one person that I want to dedicate my lifetime to because I love them so much. It's almost as if he is not convinced that I love you, that I am in love with you because I still want to explore other people-- or because I haven't had enough experiences yet.\n\nI don't agree with him. But the thing is, I just don't know. I'm losing track of what I believe in. Everything is becoming a doubt. Everything is potentially possible, because of the infinity of interpretations that exist within us. I am coming to the conclusion though that the relationships that we hold dear to our essence. It's as if we all had our own dimensions and when we share something with something else we share a dimension with them, which means inherently, that it is what defines us as well. And I know that the dimension that I share with you is the one I feel probably most secure in, the one I feel most myself, the one I feel is taking up the most space of my own personal, emotional dimension. So therefore, I ask myself a thing or two about us. This also on the basis as well of the problems and the pressure I feel from my dad right now because I am understanding that the dimension we share is coming out of focus, and it is the one in which I used to feel secure in, and maybe I am scared to know that I am the one to choose now. I am scared of the fact that I can even think or ponder these things, or give them so much importance... and even come to conclusions such as the open ended ones that I do come up with.\n\nI need to speak to you and I need you in my life because you are the person I know I share a bigger dimension with, one in which I can identify myself in. Because these are the things that make us feel alive--- being able to interact and share our interpretation of the world with someone. Otherwise, if you do everything on your own and you make your decisions based only on what it is that you want, then nothing really has a value anymore.... I mean you have prescribed your own value to something or a decision but if you don't share it with someone, what's the point. It's like writing a fucking beautiful book and never sharing it with the world, in order to feed off it and create new things for other to feed off them. I don't know if this is all wrong. If I am just having one of the biggest experiences of existential paranoia I have ever had. As well as, I don't know if this how you view things as well, or if maybe I am just not making any sense whatsoever. But right now... I am losing that touch with you that I want in order to be happy, because I can be myself, entirely in the conscious and subconscious with you. And I am asking myself, now that I am coming to the point where all the decisions that include myself, such as where I am going after uni and if I want to break away from my dad and my family in a certain sense, because I couldn't possibly ever explain what I am explaining to you rigth now in the hopes that they would understand... I am speaking a different language and so now I am responsible entirely for defining who I am. \n\nAnd I feel like it's true. I don't know who the fuck I am, but I know that I want you to be part of that- or no- that YOU ARE part of me. But not in a selfish, or ego-ish way. In the way that every one of the people we know are parts of us. But you are a big part, and I'm starting to ask myself that maybe I want to start making decisions based on trying to be with you. Right now. Make those decisions on that basis. \n\nBut at the same time, it all sounds ridiculous. \n\n\n\n\nPlease, be honest and tell me if I sound deranged or if I am incoherent. But I am panicking. About all of this. I needed to write it down. \nI need to know your opinion on all of this, to understand whether it's all just a big knot of knots inside my head, that tomorrow will be strings or if it's something I, we, really have to talk about. \n\nI'm sorry. \nI love you. I love you. I love you Babi bella.",

Babi bella.\nThe fact that I don't when I will see you next now feels just very wrong. \n\nBut I'll leave that to talk about in another moment. You aren't rusty blinders, you're the beauty and magic that exists behind them!! Excuse me for wrongly expressing myself. I just felt disconnected in the more superficial dimension with you because I had no idea what was going on. Only about the tornados!! \nI listen to this while I write ( I don't know why I feel it's important): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8dn2NF5Vtc\n\nIt's not the best, but listening to it for the first time and suits the melancholy, happy and sad mood I am when I write to you. I tear a bit every time now. I'm sappier every time. Because I miss holding you and I miss kissing you and I miss embracing you secretly on living room couches and in small corners of this damn city. \n\nWhich wasn't there before. It's a new kind of missing.... It's a sort of helplessly heavy and weighty absence that I feel without you (physically). \n\nI'm sorry.... this was supposed to be a message to tell you about my life, or what's going on in this chapter anyway, which isn't really a new one to the one that you left me at (physically, that is!).... \nI'm in Rome because I had to operate my teeth. Well, they, others, the dentist had to operate my teeth and insert two screws where the missing ones are in order to eventually screw in the permanent fake teeth in September. I start with this because at the moment I really wish to smoke a cigarette (or I wish I could watch you smoking one because I fucking love the way you smoke... just thinking about it makes me...I dunno what it makes me, but... ok I will stop with this) and I couldn't smoke for a week, even though of course I have in the past weekend. I did last until Friday. I don't think I haven't not smoked consistently for an extended period of time like this in years. It makes me realise how fucking fast time slips. It really does, even though it feels like ages ago that I saw you.... Ages. \n\n\nThis together of people is quite enchanting as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgY7eGBKPQ\n( i think you will like them)\n\nThe headline of this chapter at the moment is a bit of a distasteful encounter with my dad, and ultimately with myself. \nI don't really feel like writing about this, but I will anyways because it sort of really illustrates where I am at. \n( i miss you, so much, babs......babs....come back? )\nIt's been a while now that my dad has pushed me to try and find some sort of internship this summer, or a work placement of some kind. I think you know this. You helped me with that application for the BBC.\nWell, anyways. I was dismissed by the BBC and ultimately, I didn't put much effort into finding anything else. Stupidly, really. Because on a lesser level, I knew this was necessary in order for my dad to be satisfied or rather, happy with me and I wouldn't have had issues telling him I would fuck off travelling for the rest of the summer, after this damn internship. \nI haven't found anything. My dad came to the house a couple of weeks ago in London. Everything climaxed. The fact that our house was a \"pigpen\" full of people that \"don't seem to have any ambition\" and my lack of mentioning the subject of the internship made him go ape shit in silly words. I told him to leave the house.... I was upset and felt judged and didn't understand that he wasn't only upset about the house but about my lack of interest and ambition for something o per lo meno....for finding something that I wish to do (career wise I suppose...)\nNow I am here, and we have had a couple of intense conversations in which I have come to terms with needing to find a work placement during summer. Especially if I wish to ask him for money in order to go to festivals and travel around Europe... And also, I have become slightly lazy from that point of view I suppose.... ? I keep talking about having no fucking clue of what I want to do, but I minus well throw myself into something. It's hard. Or I am lazy... I throw myself on my passion for human contact and interaction in order to safeguard myself from thinking- FUCK-  I HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE- I HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT- I NEED A STARTING POINT. I don't feel like I have a starting point.\n\nNow- in this moment- I just realise how fucking confused I am- but I am not. Babs, Babs..... I-m sorry about this jibber jabber. I'm not crazy.  \n\n(I don't know if I have told you about this song but please listen to it.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nCtPJUyolE I hope you like it. It's psychologically assisted me in the past months) \n\n\nOk..... now this is too much. I wanted to tell you about a mushroom trip that I had the other day... I wanted to share thoughts with you.... Things that are a little less tangible in the \"real\" world, but much more fucking tangible for me to talk about. But I feel like now I have written too much. And essentially, there is too much. We need to speak.\n\nI am a bit distraught. \nI'm sorry about this crazy conclusion of words. \n\nBut, back to your essence. In my core.\n\nI'm really glad that you are feeling better about the job. I told you this already the last time we spoke. I am happy that this is the case. I knew it would have been though, I think. Additionally though, I don't like the fact that it is stressful for you.... Are you gonna spend the rest of your life being stressed Babs?\nI don't mean this to sound harsh at all... I worry a bit. If it's something that you are able to give yourself to (even if not entirely) then I don't think it should be stressing you. Maybe you need to learn, or reconquest how to canalise your energies in order to maintain an equilibrium on the emotional spectrum?\n\nAnd finally, how did it go with your mom? And with the chic? \nI have things to say in this context but I would rather talk about it verbally. I don't know enough.\n\n\nTi saluto adesso. \nbarbara, ti amo.",

I would like to be real in all its entirety in order to kiss your forehead, hold your hand and and to wish you a magic day just by looking straight into the eye.\n\nI hope so much that today all the happiness that your essence has bestowed upon others, with your smile and your compassion and your genuine nature, your energy, will be returned to you. I wish you so much magic. But, not just today, that's the thing. Every day. Every day of the year. Every night of the year. \n\nReally. \n\nBabi bella, ti amo. La sensazione della tua mancanza mi brucia il petto e mi sfoca la visione. \n\nI love you----I love you--- I love you. Thank you, so much, for being. For us.",

It was Tuesday, and it's my practice day and the class is definitely not as stimulating as it was last year. It's usually subdued. Tuesdays are very slow and very heavy for me.\n\nIt was sunny though, and I was reflecting upon the space because it seems so strange to me that places hold such a huge amount of temporal dimensions, and I could feel your presence having been there. You walked into my mind- literally walked into my conscious. I had a fucking stupidly big smile on my face. Babs, it's one of the first times I could feel your essence entirely embedded within mine. I was wondering what you were doing and I could feel your existence with so much fervour it scared the negative out of my being.\n\nThis moment was one of pure bliss and it is all thanks to your fucking magnificent presence in my life. You were- indeed- everywhere. You are- indeed- everywhere.\n\nYesterday instead, I walked around the city center with Mara, a new friend of mine. She's a fascinating creature- very quiet and reserved but has a rough edge that really stands out. Anyhow, we walked from Charing Cross into the art store we once went to, proceeded to ChinaTown and then visited the National Portrait Gallery. Nobody was particularly leading the trajectory but it happened to be chronologically in parallel with an evening I spent with you last year. I missed you so much I needed to almost throw up. I remembered the conversations we had in one of the rooms of the museum...the picture I took of you on the escalator on my wall (one of my favorites) and your words were still hanging to the atoms of the matter of the walls. \n\nIt's beginning to hurt- your physical absence. I don't want to tell you to upset you. I just need to transmit to you this so very passionate longing I have for you in certain moments. Ti amo. Ti Amo. Ti Amo. \n\nBut at the same time, thank you- thank you for having lifted my spirit on Tuesday. Thank you for us. Damn.\n\nLife here progresses... I am managing to slowly give a balance to the days of nothingness and the days that are full. I am going to participate in an exhibition I think... Today was beautifully sunny and I biked home, was alone and I really fucking pushed myself to create. It wasn't as successful as I wished but I felt full anyways. I think I am meteopathic. If you can say that.\n\nI hope that wherever you are right now, whatever you are doing you are doing it with passion and with humble determination as you do.... as you do as a magic being would do... You are magic.\n\nI love you.\n\nLet's please skype soon. <3",

I find that when I write, especially in the abundance that we do to each other it's easy to lose the weight. Of each and every single word and sentence. It gives me the possibility of transporting myself into that diaspora of US. :)\n\nEspecially the last things that you wrote to me on whatsapp, and ESPECIALLY the last fucking beauty that is the string of words that you wrote to me last on this social network. You talk about heart skipping beats, I'll tell you right now when I read what you write to me my heart ceases to exist inside my body because it is placed in a body of light. \n\nWhen I say to you, that you are my anchor of \"sanity\" I mean it in such a way that you are the spark that brings me back down to reality in my mind. Amor mio, as you say, I am en explorer, of people, of sensations, of experience. I suppose I have been exploring to a certain extent and all the frequencies to which my mind has been exposed to have been so variated that it is difficult to keep up with the one I wish to call my own and the one that sets a stability that I suppose I need in order to function. Isolation is the phenomenon I suppose I feel in moments of panic. I think of you and things all come back together again. Because you are an anchor. You are an anchor like mother nature is to me, you are an anchor like the feeling of Rome is, you are an anchor like the sun is, you are an anchor like museums are. But you are the epitome of that anchorage but in such a way not that I depend on it- but in such a way that no matter how shit things could possibly seem (and yes, seem) I know that I have been able to experience, and I am experiencing the depths of what we call this life. A pocket of feeling and exuberance. <3 A pocket of beauty and words and sensations and love. I love you.\n\nLet's skype one of these evenings this week. <3 Let's set it. It's been too long now.

      "content": "Love love love of mine. Excuse the gap between my reading and my replying to this. But be sure that when I read it my heart sank and skipped and my insides churned and sparked way too many times. So that I couldn't immediately reply. I needed time to digest. I don't like internet communication because it leaves no space... I think I am made for the letter-writing times because I need the spaces between things...\n\nAnyway.\n\nI don't think I can properly reply to you right now because too many things are happening and my head is in a million different places and hardly ever actually with me. But I wanted to say that any absence on my part does not mean that you are absent from my life, my conscience. I don't know. You're in my conversations with people, and the places I go to and the people I meet and the things I see. But I've already told you this too many times.\n\nParticularly though, I've been entranced by a letter from Jean Paul Sartre to Simone de Beauvoir, who he was madly in love with his entire life. And well, though it might sound a little bit exaggerated it is nothing short of what I have always said to you. Just with even better words.\n\nSo in my own lack, here goes a truly deeply beautiful expression of the inexpressible:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am mastering my love for you and turning it inwards as a constituent element of myself. This happens much more often than I admit to you, but seldom when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing to you. Try to understand me: I love you while paying attention to external things. At Toulouse I simply loved you. Tonight I love you on a spring evening. I love you with the window open. You are mine, and things are mine, and my love alters the things around me and the things around me alter my love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI hope you don't misunderstand this 'you are mine.' This is 'you are mine' in this most free sense that any has ver had. The direct opposite of its literal sense, in fact. It is entirely personal and not at all to do with possession. If 'I am mastering my love for you and turning it inwards as a constituent element of myself' (which I think is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard) means that this love something individual, personal, inside, and not at all to do with possession or reciprocation... 'you are mine' means the same thing. \n\nYou are mine means my love for you is mine. And it changes everything around me. And it changes how I relate to people and my environment. And how I see the world. \n\nI guess maybe all that I want to say, out of this big jumble of words that is a mind in pieces trying to come together... I guess maybe what all of these pieces want to say is thanks for giving me the experience of this love. Whatever it is. This feeling that is unlike anything I have ever felt before, and truly close to something that is simply PURE. Which is so rare to find. Its beauty continually astounds me. So thank you.\n\nAnd I love you.\n\nI have something else to send to you, but I will do that later because this has gotten too dense.  If I have not managed to express what I think (or what I think that I think) I think this other piece will clarify it. Later.\n\nFor now just this.\n\nPs. I cannot indulge in memories. I try not to because I find it a little scary because I don't want to miss you too much. Just saying this makes me miss you too much.\n\nPps. I am sorry I didn't say anything about what you said to me. It is so nice to hear about you. I wonder how you are now... I do wish you were right next to me. I hope you are and feel found right now. That you have the grip that you want. But these words feel silly to write. I need to talk to you and hear your voice... I cannot write about myself for now. Now. I hope we talk soon.\n\nI hope these words don't fall short of expectations. Mind... shattered. \n\n...ti amo sempre.",

The telepathy is no longer a seed of fascination, but rather a growth of the realisation that our connection is in constant evolution and so omnipresent. Omnipresent. Not just present.\n\nI think of you constantly and the distance between us is painful and you are right in saying that our presences are always there. At the moment I feel it most in which my touch with sanity is not so clear. I think of you, and comes back. But that sort of sanity that I suppose is healthy, that sort of sanity that gives that stability that I suppose I need every now and then living in a reality that I have sort of fallen into in which on the list of priorities \"stability\" is definitely not one.\n\nI miss you today, because I avidly indulged in thinking of moments with you. Pizza, Fregene... listening to your voice, and observing the way you move your hands- your mouth. As well as fantasizing about living in an apartment with you in manhattan (in black&white) watching you read, and making, being love underneath window sills flooding in morning light.... \n\n\nI sound funny. I know your either smiling, or laughing (as per usual) right now... But fuck, man.\n\nLife here is cool I think. I mean the rhythms haven't changed. Same old- as I said. As I say-- drugs, emotional hardship and drama in the house, and conflicts of my priorities and the my priorities in other people that I care about. I feel in control now, even though I lost it for a bit last week because of too much, too much, too much. Smoking weed, forgetting everything and thinking I am going crazy. \n\nAnd being consistently, creatively inactive, unsuccessful. But I think I have taken hold of my self again now. I just need to make sure I do things- I can't have too much control of WHAT I do, but how MUCH...and that is not the best, but I am fine with it at the moment.\n\n\nI participated in an exhibition with some gd students, but I left everything to the last minute and wasn't so happy because I ended up printing out three old photographs and didn't push myself to create. But animation has been getting at me now and Sofia is now becoming my creative muse, even though in my daily life she is cause of much nuisance and frustration. Not always though.\n\nEverything else seems a little bit insignificant. I feel like filling you in, but all I want to tell you is how much I want you here by my side with a cup of tea and talk about things...any thing. Spontaneous conversation flow, that never seems to finish with you. Or not seems, it never does. So full, constantly filling each other.\n\nBut you fill me in- I am so happy to think that you have interacted again with your cousin, that the ocean is once again inspiring you, that family closeness is giving you warmth, that working alongside your mom is bestowing upon you stimulus. \n\nEi Barbara, ti amo. :)",

Even though I have an urgency to speak, paired with a sensation that writing will do me good.\nAs per usual, all the things that I have wanting to speak to you about and give to you are all a massive jumble in my head. My need to communicate with you peaked two nights ago when I had a very intense and elongated conversation, which I suppose could also be considered a discussion (which I bealieve to be a very accurate word) with my father about a series of things and it also included my love for you and the renewed realization that you are such an important person in my life. \nAnd you are. And I was thinking about how you are not only my friend, but one of those people who reaches far beyond that. I think you are the only person in my life apart from my very sibling that I trust with all my heart. Truly. I suppose that is why. And another discovery is that the reason why I believe we hold so true to each other is because we have a repricocity and equality in the amount that we love and lean on each other. I explained all this to my dad to no avail, as he interpreted it as my thinking that I don't think many people in my life actually love me. It isn't true, it's just that with you it's different, as just explained.\n\nThat said, I don't think that descriptions of admiration towards each other will ever end. I say this with a touch of humour. Expressed in such a way that can be interepreted in many ways, but I meant for it to be funny, and in addition I didn't feel like adding an infantile emoticon such as this one XD to top it off. XD\n\nI'm wondering how you are. From the small snippets of interaction on yesterday I don't know if my intuitions are right in thinking that you are in a lighter mood and that things in your head are a little less heavy then they were at the beginning of the summer. I am greedily glad that your departure from London has not been settled yet, even though I really would like to know what your plans are if there are any at bay. And if there aren't any, that's equally fine, as long as your good. :) \nI am curious to know what film you are making with Roman as well. From what I know of him, as per, seen and spoken, you two are an odd pair and I'm curious to see what would be created out of that duality.\n\nI really don't like the way I am speaking (well.. writing) but I'll continue because I am on a bit of a roll, and please don't think that I am expecting a reply because all I want is to speak. Speak to you. Long nights in London await. I want to come back now. This vacation, or rather lapse in fucking time has lasted way too long! I feel in limbo once more, sort of like I did those last few days in London in June, but less desperate I suppose. \n\nI am also sort of afraid to come back to London. This is where my discussion with my dad comes into relevance. \nWhile we were speaking, I had a sort of revelation. I understand why my first time on acid was so fucked up as much as I understand a grand part of my social insecurities... or rather the underlying feeling of WRONG and TABOO in my doings at psy parties or in my hanging with people such as Lora (i am not explaining this the way it is in my head but I will continue anyways). It is because I have always had as a point of reference embedded within my fucking soul, I feel, my father's ideals/principles and ways of being. Example: when i was on acid at the squat rave, I didn't feel completely free, and I felt like I was not part of the together, simply because I knew that I was part of some other fucking world that lives underneath the theology of my father and the lifestyle that surrounds him.\n\nThis summer, specifically in Spain and at Ozora, I finally felt free of this fucking layer of wrong and not-part-of-the-togetherness feeling. \nI felt detached.\n\nI just wrote a whole other paragraph explaining why I am afraid of going back to London but only now realizing how silly my worries are, and that I need to stop thinking so deeply about things because it leads to a benign superficial realm of thought. So I deleted it.\n\nI'm sorry I am dumping this massive stream of thought into your mind's bowl, but I needed to tell you and I don't know why.\n\nBut this is also why I would like to speak to you because dialogue will help me feel less like I am dumping all my shit onto you and rather simply asking for your opinion on my infantry.\n\nThere are other things, but I really don't want to overwhelm you. They include the fact that mom is drinking again, and the other night when my father was telling me all these things I felt like I was a black body/essence being squashed by walls of rubber and you were the only person I knew would bring me back to peace again and I think that is why I needed to tell you all these things.\n\nI love you.\nI really do.

      "content": "Hello hello my beautiful friend.\nHere I am again. Having failed again at keeping in touch in a civilized manner.\nThe story is old by now so there is no point in telling it, and my hope is that you somehow telepathically and somewhat extraordinarily empathize with me and this stupid state of mind that I find myself in.\nIt's hard to write, this summer.\nExtremely hard. I tried writing for myself and couldn't get past three lines. It's like pen and paper have matching magnetic poles and will.just.not.stick together.\nI cannot write about myself, as I told you before. And thus I kept waiting for the time when I would be able to and it didn't come. So I'm wirting to you now and I don't know where it's gonna go.\n\nFirst and foremost...\nThank you for your beautiful beautiful beautiful previous message. Reading it made my heart fill with joy in that way that only you can ever do.\nI am happy that you liked my message. it was the least that i could when really i wished you were here so that i could hug. i'm happy i guess to have been able to transfer at least a fraction of that emotion to you. \nAs always, I am perplexed by your fascination or love of my writing and I don't see how a person such as Michael (from what you've told me of him) would be fascinated by my words. I just don't see it! Especially these days, when the idea of writing scares me and I feel silly to even ever have contemplated having any sort of way with words. I don't know. I don't know...\nBut it makes me happy that you like it.\nAnd thank you, thank you so much. it means so much. I love you.\n\nAnd of course I know what you mean by being in love in the greater sense. I am in love with your soul too. Always have been! You beautiful thing!\n\nWhere are you now? Back in Rome or getting back this weekend? I have lost track of time. Strange.\n\nAnother reason I didn't write immediately is I think at the time that I read your message I didn't feel fit to write about what you said about your mother. And that saddens me so much because what am I here for if not for those moments? (again I ask you to inhumanly empathize and bare with me through this period... I am trying to become more present. get over the shit in my head. i promise!)\n\nWhat you told me. about the phone call and divorce case deeply struck me. chilled me to the bone. I don't know but i think it's because i have been in similar situations. not with my mother but with my aunt in my dad's side of the family who never got over her divorce and went on to become dependent on anti-depressants and with a friend of my mom's that also went through the same thing, and then my mom's super rich friend in Rio who is rich but deeply superficial and deeply stuck on shallow things as if to replace something deeper that is missing. \nAnd i can only imagine how it must feel when it is your own mother... I remember the feeling that they evoked.. of spiraling down a black hole... dizzying and icy at the same time and the anger just plain anger at their not being able to get over it to get out of it to let go of meaningless things.\nI don't know what to say.\nHow are you doing? How is she?\nI'm sorry if writing about this has brought up things you had forgotten about. Don't feel that you have to reply necessarily.\n\nI miss you.\nI wanna talk to you.\nWhen do you think might there be a possibility for a skype call?\n\nAlso, about what I was gonna send to you in the post. It's actually something I meant to send you last summer and I recently found it again in my things. But someone else is sending something to you. I don't know if you got it yet and I can't tell you 'cause it's a surprise, but I only decided to send what I had to send after this person wrote to me asking for your address so -  credit goes first and foremost to this person for being adorable and sweet. I suppose. I don't know what you're gonna think! Or what it is actually...\n\nMe in a quick list because i cannot do it any other way:\n\n1. i have written more cover letters than i can count.\n2. got an interview at a really good company but didn't get through in the end :(\n3. i got a first in my degree! wooooo! (i was not too excited, somehow)\n4. i am working picking trash over the weekend at Wireless Festival with Joe and Becca and a bunch of other 'smiths people because it's \u00c2\u00a3410 i don't even care\n5. i have bee reading quite a bit and now i am reading a book called \"How Should a Person be?\" and the tile sounds almost like self-help but it isn't and the cover makes it look like Devil Wears Prada sortta book but it isn't. It is incredibly insightful and i think it is touching me to the core. The title spoke to me from the bookshelf. It's aquestion that had been drumming in my head for the past 3 months: How should I be? How should a person be? How can people be? I don't wanna get into it now but hopefully we will talk about it later.\n6. i wanted to tell you at the time but forgot: a was in the Passing Clouds newsletter a couple of weeks ago. the one where they talked about the peaceful protests in Brazil! The 'reader' that they quotes is meeeee :) it felt nice. i had emailed them asking them to include the protests in Brazil in their next newsletter and just wrote some info on it. They were extremely enthusiastic about it and happy about my emailing them. but i had no idea they were actually gonna use my words! slightly embarrassing but i was happy about it, ultimately.\n\nI think that's all that I want to say for now.\n\nThank you for your beautiful message. You are beautiful. Thank you for making me feel warm inside and giving me such positivity.\nI love you my friend. I love you.\nI hope you are feeling blessed.\n\nI love you I love you\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It only seems and I suppose is the ideal time to answer your beautiful message as well as trying to pry some information about your life, right now- presently, out of you so that i can place you into  a colorful background into my head, in order to then transfer those colors into your own world which you define a \"haze\".\n\nI read your message to michael. Well.. Parts of it anyhow. I am pretty positive it made my day as well as making my birthday in general. He was fascinated. \nWhat the fuck man. I have no other words to express my marvel for the way that you string words and the sensations that bubble up inside me when i read them. Sei pazzesca. \nIt reminds me of how in love I am with your soul, and in the greater sense of 'in love'... It exceeds that. You know what I mean... I hope. \n\nI feel like I have now been here for a much longer time than what time defines, and this has given the possibility for the initial magic to fade away and the past week and a half experiences have taken stride on all shades of the emotional spectrum. A german girl came here and it did not get along with michael and brought the positivity and comfort levels down but then she left and today another south african guy arrives. Also, have gotten into a few arguments with the american guy ( other voulenteer) over petty issues and differentiation in mentality as followed up bu differentiation in culture, I believe. Not only, though\nReady to leave and am on sunday. I am going to Granada for a week. Don't really know what I will do when I am there- it's supposed to be a very aesthetically pleasing location. Lots of arabic influence on the architecture... Excited. \n\nHad a terribly rough time the other night. My mom calls me at four in the morning asking me if I am on drugs. Drunk. In company of some random guy called tom. Claims she is contacting the fbi to \"investigate\" divorce case with my dad. In florida.\n\nWas really upset... I don't know what to do ( there isn't anything to do unfortunately ) and I am not so sure why I feel the need to tell you but it's taken up a lot of space in my head and incited angry vibes at the world and dependency and addiction and superficiality and all that constructs the plastic ceran wrap of shit that she's permanently wrapped herself in. She's been in the same loop of thoughts and events that repeats utself over and over... For the past four- five years now. Can't come out... \n\nI don't know how much i have written. I think it might be quite a bit but anyhow I will continue in order to express once again the desire to hear about you and what's going on in your life currently and how are you feeling. To follow up with : if all is not positive then remember always, please, to attempt to surround yourself with good vibes that are emitted by reading books, writing, morning sun lit strolls, kisses, rosie, museums, hampstead heath park. \nAnd that whatever pieces you have managed to find to put together in the puzzle that is your future direction are not causing you too much unrest but rather, excitement. \n\nPlease. \n\nI love you.

I have a MASSIVE pile of stuff that has just been sitting in there that I have not worn in fucking ages...or at all in any case.\nYesterday was a strange day. I had to wait a delay of the plane and without music I read about 200 pages of shantaram and I really got sucked into the story a little too much. On top of it my brit card didn't pay for the contract on my phone so I wasn't able to contact my dad to tell him I would be late for him to pick me up. I got there at nine instead of six. He was yelling at me as soon as I called him calling me inaffidabile and being really mean without hearing me out. I broke down man. I was sobbing in front of the cinturone for luggage. I don't know why the fuck. It's like I needed to cry for other things as well. It just kept pouring out. \nIt was nice but then I had a really cold encounter with my dad. Thought he was going to kill us in the car. He was driving really fucking fast and jerky. Still haven't talked to him today\nThen I went to mom's for a bit and talked with her. I told her about my acid trip because she kept prying about drugs and we ended up having a really good conversation but I know I wasn't ready to tell her yet. \nThen, I went to Chloe's house. Her mom was there. She was really fucking rude, but I ignored it. And Chloe and I really don't have the connection we once had. It was really strained until we started roughhousing and stuff and laughing about stupid things like once. All of this in the midst of her eyes and hands glued to her iphone and computer.\nIt was frustrating. I felt strange this morning but I wrote and drew while chloe was asleep and then I had a nice walk from her house all the way to mine. I felt the urge to write you a letter. I was in the mood for writing. \nNow I am home and feel a bit better, but I have realized that the familiarity and the safety of here and the people who I used to hang out with is pretty much gone. It scares me a bit.\n\nSorry my mind has been racing\nI love you. \n\nNow tell me some about you friend. x",

      "content": "My mind is buzzing again. My description was shit last night! I was tired as hell and I just wanted to write down the scenes. \nOk wait, too many things: \n\nI didn't even realize I fucking reblogged the wilding shoot from you on my dashboard! I am an idiot. Aahah it's kind of hysterical but at the same time I just fucking agree with you because in not realizing that it had been you there was something about it that just called out your name. It was a perfectly irrational and energetic assumption. So that is just fascinating in itself and I battle the banality of the coincidences, because they are far from that!\n\nSecondly, I just read your post about Cinema America. Dude, you would be so utterly happy. I have been there twice and it is fucking intense. It's quite demolished but they have put it in security. (fuck, I want to talk to you, just tried calling you on skype...) The other night I was there with Alan, Fritz and Midge after shisha. We helped these two kids who are occupying the place broom up the huge theatre hall where people can prance in sit down and smoke and there is music playing. There is also posters that explain the whole history of the cinema. I started having a pretty intense conversation with one of the guys, Tommaso and he showed us where they sleep and all the events that they have been holding. It's fucking unreal. And it's so beautiful because they have unified so many of the people. Fire fighters were ordered by the people who want to demolish the cinema to make it into an apartment complex so that they could get the occupants out but operai had helped the kids put it in security and the pompieri were absolutley cool with them giving them support. They had a kitchen built in for free and they are going to paint the walls and fix it up. And lastly, they are building a library! They have gotten donations from a bunch of places and they are building it now and I think I am going to help them\n\nOh babi babi it pains me to tell you all this because my only wish is that you were here to share this as well.\nMeep! \n\n:(\n\nYou would absolutely love it. (sorry, I know I won't make it any worst).\n\n\nOn another note, going back to the movie scenes and such it sounds extremely terrible the way I described it! I have to talk to you about it. I just I can't get over how much of a good screen play it would be. And I am so happy you can vividly imagine that one scene :) :) Aw fuck. I knew you would understand. I knew I would get through to you. \n\nSo fucking unreal. This connection. Really.\n\nI'm buzzing.\n\n\nToday, I went skiing and I was listening to dub step. I was so happy I should've just died right there. \n\nI want you here. Now. \n\nI love you. You can't imagine how much. ",

Just thought you would enjoy it.\n\n\nOn a somewhat more relevant/important note- I am at the hotel. My sister and my mom are sharing a room and my gobrother/cousin/closefamilyfriend and I are sharing a room (his name is Henry. We have adjacent rooms as well as balconies, and they are constructed out of wood, light and kind of pale. Not the rustic feel, but the new wave rustic look, kind of feel.\nThe balconies overlook on this piazza, at its center this really magical statue/fountain construction, and there are two buildings with the same aura as the interior of the hotel. New wave rustic. Really slick, and the opposite of cosy. The entire town is kinds of like this, emanating the tirolese/austrian influence in the north. Back to the piazza: it's empty. Or rather, static. There is hardly any activity and every now and then there is a lone traveller making his way across it. It's fucking silent.\nOk, now. I am sitting in the balcony, really clean and really slick remember; really stoned. \n\nI am telling you all of this because- you know those moments in life (they're usually when you're on your own) when you feel like you are in a fucking movie scene. Ok imagine that feeling but times a bajillion. Almost, like you can convince yourself that you are starring in a movie, and your mind starts whizzing and you start contemplating the metaphysical phenomenon that you are at the center of the world and everybody in it is acting at your disposal. A huge experiment.\nI'm straying from the point. \n\nI have sat on the damn terrace a number of times now and this feeling just comes on, all the time.\nIt's crazy and it's perfect at the same time. I need to draw it for you. It's a fucking film/ or a play honestly and there are three scenes already. Just imagine okay? Me sittin' there high (as per usual) contemplating things such as the egotistical thought I exposed to you previously. Second one, my personal favorite---> I am sitting there smoking a cigarette. And the shot would be taken as if you were looking onto the balcony from the outside but parallel. And out comes my god brother, who is quite a goofy character brushing his teeth with an electric tooth brush. He has a vacant look, he is wearing a white tshirt, skii pants and it's snowing. \nMy mom suddenly comes into the picture in the terrace right next to ours. Smoking her own cigarette and fretting about her nose and about he skii lesson in the morning. Henry shrugs, goes back inside.\n\nThere is a last scene but to be honest I don't want to be too overwhelming, I don't know if I was really high or if all of this is fucking genius but you must see this setting. It's driving me nuts. \n\nI needed to tell you. Because I needed to record it, and for some reason I just felt like sharing this with you. For not particular rational reason.\n\nI love you. ",

Found in Posterity: Letters of Great Americans to Their Children (UK; public library), the missive offers insight on everything from knowing whose advice not to take to the false allure of money to the joy of making things with your hands:\n\n...In relation to painting.\n\nDon't be carried off your feet by anything because it is modern \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the latest thing.\n\nGo to the Louvre often and spend a good deal of time before the Rembrandts, the Delacroixs.\n\nLearn to draw. Try to make your hand so unconsciously adept that it will put down what you feel without your having to think of your hands.\n\nThen you can think of the thing before you.\n\nDraw things that have some meaning to you. An apple, what does it mean? The object drawn doesn't matter so much.\n\nIt's what you feel about it, what it means to you.\n\nA masterpiece could be made of a dish of turnips.\n\nDraw, draw, hundreds of drawings.\n\nTry to remain humble. Smartness kills everything.\n\nThe object of art is not to make salable pictures. It is to save yourself.\n\nAny cleanness I have in my own life is due to my feeling for words.\n\nThe fools who write articles about me think that one morning I suddenly decided to write and began to produce masterpieces.\n\nThere is no special trick about writing or painting either. I wrote constantly for 15 years before I produced anything with any solidity to it.\n\nThe thing of course, is to make yourself alive. Most people remain all of their lives in a stupor.\n\nThe point of being an artist is that you may live.\n\nYou won't arrive. It is an endless search.\n\nI write as though you were a man. Well, you must know my heart is set on you. It isn't your success I want.\n\nThere is a possibility of your having a decent attitude toward people and work. That alone may make a man of you.",

Viewers are invited to feel (or not) disgusted or pleased with these images that are based on a poem by Seamus Heaney called \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlackberry Picking\u00e2\u0080\u009d; a literary piece that symbolizes (in my own interpretation) the decay of the positive and a downfall of hope. The persona is awaiting the pleasure of eating the abundant amount of blackberries that he has picked, and watches them rot. These pictures could be considered a continuation of Heaney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea, and analyze the obsession that many individuals of this degenerated world have for auto-destructiveness. The taboo desire that nobody is inclined to admit they have with the many somethings that they are aware will taint their minds with negativity is the basis of my line of thought at the moment that these were shot. \n\nThis is really something I wrote up and I have only read it through twice.

Instead of these charges, Miller faced a penalty of $600 for two citations of disorderly conduct.[20] Miller later commented: \"I don't feel like there's any need to hide the fact that I smoke pot. It's a harmless herbal substance that increases sensory appreciation.\"\nAhah, god I love him",

Well it makes me really happy that I can make you happy in some way and that I subconsciously get you. You do so much for me and I could never properly tell you because I don't wanna make things too mushy. If that makes sense? I can be a big ball of mush and cheese sometimes as spoil things.\n\nI'm so happy that when I don't make sense that's when I make the most sense to you because really its when I make the most sense to me too but most people don't/wouldn't get it. If anything i think i think it doesnt make sense because im so used to having to censor certain things with most people because it would just be useless to even try to express those things...!You get me in ways that no one else does and I have a connection with you that is quite different from anything I have or have ever had with anyone else. It's feels nice. \n\nAnyway.\nMushy peas, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes overload. I think I will stop now.\n\nI dont know if ive told you this before. There's a line in this film with Winona Ryder directed by Ben Stiller from the 90s, called Reality Bites, when Winona's character, who is super cool, says \"He's so cheesy I could eat him on a cracker!\" ...or something along those lines. I found it hilarious. And it also made me een more paranoid than usually am.\n\nAlright my beautiful friend.\nI am at the airport now. Writing this on my phone (which makes it surprising that I've actually written this much. I usually have no patience for iPhones) and well destination Rome! I will be seeing you at the end of the day and that is crazy. I cannot fathom this fact. But even just trying to picture it right now is making me smile :)\n\nI'll see you soon!\nTi voglio tanto bene. I can't believe I will actually be able to express that through a hug. WHAAT.\nRemember all the iloveyous and imissyous?  I hereby declares these the last ones:\nI LOVE YOU AND I MISS YOU AD I LOVE YOU AND I MISS YOU.\nAnd I can't wait to fucking see you!\n.\n.\n.\nTONIGHT!!!\n:D",

I don't think we would've created this legame (i am giong to say that in italian because I like the word and fits perfectly with what I have to say) had we not been so far away from each other. I think maybe it would've taken a longer time... I miss you so much even though I should be used to not being able to see you because it's never actually been a possibility with us being like we are now. Therefore what I am trying to get at is that I am somewhat grateful for the distance at times. Even though, now it's too much (cringe)\n\nThat's all. I think there are many tangents I could go off on with that now but I don't want to exapnd too much and scare you with my twisted mind. :) \n\nKristen Stewart will forever remind me of you. I remember that conversation we had at gay pride about it. Ahaha we have had many conversations of that beautiful creature. \nAnd yes I get that feeling with people sometimes- how they know nothing about what's going on in my head. I can just imagine how that was sitting next to your dad. Ahahaha god. Same think happened with me and my mom and that scene from goddamn Black Swan with that that hot babe of a MILA KUNIS (which for me by now has definitly beat the sex-o-meter of Stewart, On the top is SHANE SHANE SHANE)\n\nBut I know exactly how you feel because whenever I watch a movie with that woman I come out of the theatre or stand up from the couch wet as fuck not knowing what to do with myself. \n\nAs much counts with the L word. I finished the first season (well I have one episode left) I cant find the other seasons online so i think I might ask my mom to buy them for me while she is still in the US. Lol. That'll be interesting.\n\nI should stop talking about that show. The others look at me allarmingly whenever I mention it because it is so often. Lol. \n\n\nYes yes yes it would be nice if you post stuff and stuff on the wall of the group. =) I am happy I did that- I am taking more of an initiative now with things like that. Before I embarassingly really wasn't at all. I don' know what clicked inside me but it just did and I did that.\nOh and if you can, you should add people as well. Just to get it around. \n\nI do need to skype you very soon. I hope we coincidentally catch each other this week on the skype machine.\nAs has happened many times in the past.\n\nCiao bellissima brillantissima donna !\n\n",

The fact that I come into the equation with one more negative makes me feel horrible. I almost wish that we hadn't become so close just so you wouldn't have to have this as something else to be   upset about.\n\nDon't be scared. Go through this with calm. It is not the end of anything. It's just a detour, a little bump in the road you didn't see before. Adjust. Choose care- and mindfully, but also know that whatever you choose will be great 'cause the 'great' doesn't come from outside, it comes from within you.\n\nThe system is shit. The IB is shit. The fact that you have to make life changing decisions on monday is shit. But we all have to go through it somehow.

Any of it, any of it will be extraordinary and always perfect in its own way.\n\nOur friendship will have to adapt, adjust, find its way, just like it has up till now... It'll be ok. Don't worry about that now. Somehow we'll did our way to wear it, live it. (I am upset. I don't want you to think that I am not.

[though that's only because Skinny Love has been overplayed in every possible place on earth. because if it hadn't that would be my favorite because i think it's one of the best songs of all time. ...oh. i guess that makes it my favorite regardless of anything, doesn't it?]\n\nand the last thing is. and i suppose the only point of all of this is that fuck man i fucking love you and i fucking miss you.\nso much these past few days. so fucking much!\nit's starting to make me a little [increasingly more, or very,] angry.\ni talked to becks these days and she mentioned how you guys hung out over the weekend and then how they were planning on meeting up with you [hence that wall post lol] and i just got SO annoyed. because i'm just sick of not being able to see you and i don't want this feeling anymore.\n\ni just want to hug.\nthat's all.\nxx \n\n",

I miss everything and everyone and so now I'm just sort of neglecting everyone (and that is why I haven't written in a little while) because talking to you now makes me miss you more.

(why did I capitalize that? lol) He is 98% ok with somebody from his family being gay (his exact words ahaha)\nYesterday I had the first nice conversation with my mother since she got here.\nI now know that Diego hopes that whatever this thing we've got going is develops into a serious relationship. oh man oh no.\nI will probably work at the Oympics with a TV network which is amazeball meatballs!\nAnd visa things are still supremely fucked when the fuck is this situation going to fucking go away it's a permanent black cloud following me around.\n\nThat's that that's all in an inboxshell.\nI love you and I miss you and I want you with me now, you beautiful being in my life.\n\nxx\nxx\n\n",

      "content": "I am literally sitting on a rooftop right now. I have come back from Capri and you would expect me to be a in a perfectly satisfactory mood right now but I am not. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand this nothingness that I have before me- \nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it is that my mind wishes to do right now but the release of pressure is kind of odd and has really put me off. I hate this. I had a kind of scary panic attack after I wrote that inbox to you that consisted in my freaking out because of all the emotions and not knowing what do with myself.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard for me to explain things in words- or maybe it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t but this is and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk either so maybe I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain things at all but:\nI was slowly falling back into the dark again and I opened my computer, read your inbox and I immediately came back to a stand point. I think the lifeline phenomena falls back onto you now.\nI came up here and I did it in order to make the \u00e2\u0080\u009cReal\u00e2\u0080\u009d world as authentic as possible and right now I can imagine you doing something in Brasil- a conversation with a producer, an awkward kiss with Diego, a mind ramble\u00e2\u0080\u00a6anything- e t\u00e2\u0080\u0099immagino contenta per\u00c3\u00b2 perch\u00c3\u00a8 spero che lo sei- but I know you are here- the refrain by e.e. Cummings sticks- the refrain you write sticks. \nAnd- as blatantly possible- your heart I carry as well. \nBut I do wish you were here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nYou know- before I started writing all the thoughts in my head were lined up- I wanted to say certain things and I even as I was reading over the message again I was making mental notes about how I would respond and now nothing comes to mind. \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really fucked. As in- my head is fucked. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think properly. Or maybe I can but I am so afraid that if I put into words it will sound so \u00e2\u0080\u00a6simply\u00e2\u0080\u00a6stupid. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with me. I am really beginning to hate myself lately and my insecurities are slowly creeping up onto me again and I fuck up relationships.\nI want to be alone. I am glad I am up here- because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m with you in the Real world and physically away from Rylie and Kelly who are in my room right now. They have done nothing wrong but I need my space, which has been literally invaded lately by everyone\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 mainly them. I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go crazy.\nBabs, I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the answers to these questions- but what the fuck? Am I always going to be like this? I am not sure about anything- even about morality. Right and wrong are just foreign to me somehow. \nBut- reset. \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to rid myself of the fish-eye. \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking about you- we need to skype. \nI guess I will think about the things that have worked. My grandparents left last Friday- I had a last conversation with them before they left and it was a nice and genuine one. I followed your advice- which I think I already basically knew, but I had to refresh the thought. Thankyou. \nHow are things with your mom? I have kind of stabilized a weird okay relationship with my mom. We had a really weird conversation the other day I want to talk to you about- I realized some things that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we take into account ourselves, as daughters. \n\nE con un tocco di finezza- te sei scaricata quello!? ;)\n\nMan, we need to talk. (When do we not?)\n\nI am leaving to go camping with everyone on Saturday. Then I will be gone until Wednesday I think.\n\nI love you. \n\nManchi Babi Bella Bella Bella.\n\n",

      "content": "(maybe go read this on a rooftop. maybe.)\n\nIsa Isa Isa my god I wish were there to be able to just go over to your house, give you a hug and take you somewhere, anywhere, with nobody else and therefore nothing to worry about... other than all the shit that goes through our heads, but if it were just me and you on the top of a building somewhere, we could work it all out. I would take out every single one of the worries in your head and show you that really everything is ok. If anything, even if things are shit, they are really actually ok because you have people to support you. And when you feel most utterly and life-haltingly alone, when even all the people you know you \"have\" feel too distant, I am actually there. Not distant. Not as distant as I might seem, like every other person seems to be because that is simply the nature of human existence - No. It doesn't apply in this case. You know that e.e. cummings poem:\n\ni carry your heart with (i carry it in my heart)\n\nWell, that's how I feel about the people that I care about most genuinely and wholly in my life. I can count them in one hand and I'll just tell you now - you're one of them. By some magic that I still have to figure out, you have carved out your own little corner inside of me, in the shortest and strangest amount of time. By strange I mean that it wasn't linear, because as linear time goes, things like this need a little bit more time to happen, at least with me. But time isn't linear anyway, is it? So really I have known you for centuries and centuries., in which case this is perfectly standard. \n\nSo I carry your heart, I carry it in my heart and therefore you are a part of me, and being a part of me, you are never alone, because I care about you as much as I care about myself. I swear. It may not seem normal, natural, true or even possible, but it is. This is part of who I am and maybe you have figured it out by now - other people can many, many times come before me in my world. Usually that's a bad thing. In this case it isn't because it come from the fact that,\n\nI carry your heart, I carry it in my heart.\n\nWe would be on a rooftop somewhere right now, and I would extract every single one of the worries in your head (the little bastards). Remove the treacherous, cancerous torments almost surgically, and we'd go through them one by one. Every. single. one. Because you are a part of me and so there is nothing, not one thing, that you would have to be ashamed of.\n\nWell then finally, after this, which would be perhaps the most painful process, would come my favorite part and the whole point of this which would be that I would show, through whatever means necessary, that you are beautiful and perfect and everything is ok.\nAnd now I am repeating this again, but everything is ok because even if it isn't, I carry your heart in my heart now and so you are never alone and if you are never alone then it's all ok. I wish I could explain but all I can do is repeat this! If you are not alone, truly not alone, then everything is ok. It's just... logical.\n\nWhat I mean is, if you are not alone, then you can go through hell but you can always tell me. And telling me isn't like telling any person, because you are a part of me so there is virtually no judgement, just recognition and understanding. And by that I mean you can go be a prostitute right now because you can't be fucked to do anything else and though I would try with all my might to stir you away from that desolate path, I wouldn't look down on you.\n\nI wish we could be on a rooftop right now because that helps get things back in perspective. You know, sometimes we go into the dark spaces and we start to see the world through a fisheye lens (it looks very cool in that Amelie film, but it's terrifying in real life, isn't it?). Things just look like they are all coming at you. And it doesn't just look like it - you feel it too. It's like your feelings become fisheyed... you know. Like they're all trying to eat you up. Like going through a haunted house (I think Amelie goes through one too, in the film)\n\nWe would be on that rooftop and from the rooftop you can start seeing things through a standard lens again. Reset. And also things look a lot more beautiful and a lot less harmful and you feel a lot stronger. And also there would be no one else, and so virtually no worry of judgement, but without being alone, which helps, too.\n\nI wish that all of that were enough, but of course you would still worry about Rylie and your mother. \n(And not about being fat because I would take that away immediately because I would show you that you are beautiful because you are. You are one of the most beautiful people I know. Yes, because I know you 'inside' and all that schnazzle. But also because you are HOT I mean it man, I do. ...am I dying of embarassment right now? Yes... yes I am)\nAll those worries would be there but I would be there and you are a part of me, so that would make you feel stronger.\nBecause the weight of the world wouldn't be all on your shoulders. It isn't!\n\nI hope so much that you manage to get past and over Rylie. You will you will but I wish I could make it happen now. (As for Rylie, I am so fucking angry that she would start making out with that chick in front of you. What is it with people, really?!) Whatever happens, though, dont let it turn into something bigger, like a need for recognition or not feeling loved/wanted, or worthless, in any way. Because dude, look at this - you have just received a friggin love letter.\n\nDon't let the issues with your mom and family get to you. Just always remember who you are and try to understand them. Compassion. They dont see. You are younger and wiser. You see, but they don't. Understand that they don't.... Love them for what they are because having negative feelings is only harmful to you, in the end. Don't participate in the hypocrisy if you don't want to - keep true to yourself or else you will hate yourself. Just remember to not be selfish. Remember how much you can take and how much they can take. Remember also, though it 's a little harsh and annoying to understand, that there is a time and place for things. Somethings should be kept on rooftops. If anything, because they are too special for mundane reality. They don't see, and probably won't see. Be compassionate and loving.\n\n...Well this has gotten ridiculously long!\n\nIn the physical world I am in Rio right now looking out my window at the view of the more than 10story high building in front of me, with construction sounds that have been piercing through my brain since  7o'clock this morning. \nBut the physical world isn't actually always the Real world. Mostly never, actually, apart from like, when I finally get to give you a hug. The physical will be the Real, then.\nBut mostly the physical world isn't the Real world, and in the real Real world, I am on a rooftop now with you, switching lenses, surgically extracting cancerous torments, and showing you beauty within and without.\n\nI love you with everything. I do.\n\nWouldn't it be so great if we could step in and out of the physical and the Real world whenever we wished?\nGuess where I'd be!\n\n  \n\n",

Everything is indeed tumbling down at once right now in my head. Everything. I feel like utter shit and I can't let it out and this is my only way- to write it down. But to write it down to myself would be pointless for my head because it seems to only be able to write for an audience- so I have chosen you because I trust you and... I don't know I am not even probably making sense right now but Babs- we went to this party last night and I got really high and the first thing I know I am stuffing every singular piece of food in my mouth from chocolate bombs to pizza to cake- it was horrid- fucking horrid. \nThen I find myself going to the bathroom with kelly inside the room with me and all of a sudden rylie just comes in and they start kissing and making out- while I am sitting there doing an every day thing that every day people do every day whilst watching this scene of lust and love and I don't know what and I just wanted to die right there in order to recieve some recgonition. I wanted to die. \nOn top of everything else my entire family on my mother's side is a fucking facade. The manipulation and the inauthenticity of all the information we share with each other is pathetic. \nI have woken up this morning and I feel fat, sad, mad, I can't hear a thing and I feel like dieing again and this all really just sucks and the only person who I could think to write to was you and I don't know if that is good or bad but I just take it for what it is. \n\nI love you.

Like...my reading. My grandparents are here. \n\nI feel guilty for not doing things- I can't embrace this nothingness. I don't know. And it's wierd because this will probably the longest, un-busiest summer of a lifetime but I can't enjoy it. But I am going to concerts and stuff and doing things that other years mi pesava sempre il culo di fare so I am having a really nice time. Last Sat I went with the group of friend along with Ellie and Becks to see a dubstep artist at Branca. It was so fucking fun but I am so sore now and I have really bad bruises on my legs. Lol. Well not kind of lol but yes kind of lol. And then yesterday was the potluck and I feel stupid just telling you all this as a string of things and yes I wish we could talk. I think it's time to set a date.\nBut- the potluck was fucking insane. I love Mrs. Nace. Like, I actually really love her- she is awesome and all kinds of scialla and her husband Franco is also the coolest person in the world.\n\nTeehee I have never been so relaxed and dazed out on a Sunday in my life. It was great. \n\nTo fill in on the questions (XD)... Stuff with rylie is wierd because kelly is here and I am sad because I realized that the time we had to spend alone is finished and I wish I had embraced that a bit more now that her other half is always around and I am thirdwheeling like a boss all the time.\n\nI wish things weren't like this so much sometimes. I think back to last year and it hurts hurts hurts. I'm sure you know the feeling but it is easy now to get rid of it. But I hate it... I hate this situation and sometimes I even hate her.\nShe'll never really exchange the love that I have for her. Really. \n\nOn a lighter note- I think I looked a bit hideous at prom but it was alright and that already seems like 4 years ago ahaha. And I have kind of decided what to do for uni and I want to tell you about it properly. We've decided that if I get the score I will go to Goldsmiths- for a variety of reasons che non mi metto a spiegare adesso.\n\nAnd yes Babs- I am fucking excited to be possibly living in the same city as you even thought it will be so wierd because we have been so only used to this cyber connection. \n\nMeep. :)\n\n\nanyways FUCK :F All your news was brilliant and I want to talk to you real bad about things. \nThe fact that you are so involved and in what you want to be doing is so so so good and I am really happy for you- I am glad that you are doing things now and stuff. MMmmm I want to hear about it though. Poi mi dirai. \n\nI think you probably know what I have to say about your thing with this brilliant- sounding guy. You have real issues with embracing your raging gay-ness. XD Don't take this as an offence really- I can understand why there would be difficulties in trying to understand those feelings but the answer if in front of your face you just need to take it and accept it. 'nuff said! Unless I am completely wrong and I have no idea what I am talking about because maybe it's all a bit deeper than that....but maybe not ;)\n\nBut do have fun.\n\nCAN WE PLEASE TALK. I wish you were online right now.\n\nI miss miss miss missss you I don't think I can say it anymore. \n\n<3",

Tim Burton never fails to amuse me...giuro. Don't know if you like his recent stuff but I really enjoyed watching it and Johnny Depp wil forever own my heart.

These days it has really been sucking as my vision is progressively getting worst and I cant fucking go anywhere without my glasses. It's really frustrating to be honest.\nBut these are really silly details- anyways that is mainly why I have not sitten ...whoa wtf sat down and written...ahahahah sitten!! what the hell.\n\nAND FUCK YES YES YES YES I AM DONE. Yesterday was interesting. It feels really strange and wierd and I think it has to still settle in completely especially because everyone finishes friday and I was one of the only ones to finish yesterday. \n\nI hope the grades are okay...you know I really don't mind at this point. I really put in more than I thought I could for the studying and it's all good so yeah. I don't want to worry about it (maybe english has got me going a little queasy...but oh well)\nFor History you should've seen me...We had paper 1 and paper 2 and the ridiculous amoutn of time they give you for paper 1 got me all wound up and I started sobbing and screaming in the little tiny break going FUCK THIS. FUCK THE IB. FUCK THE SYSTEM. FUCK FUCK FUCK.\n\nIt was funny thinking about it two hours later lol. It's all good. But yeah fuck this shit. I am glad I am done with it. \n\n\nDude- it's not like we have never hung out before. Ofcourse I will like the real Barbara (whatever that means). That's because I alreday do and that is just a silly notion alltogether!!! Ofcourse I like you - I always have and always will.. MACHEDICI!?\n\nI wish teleportation did exist so I could come over there and slap you accross the face- wake you up and then hug you tight and let you know that you are ready for the real world and you are a child in all the positive ways and individual can be but you are also an adult and that you know way more than your average 21 year old knows and you have the ambitions that not many have. \n\nI bei",

(i already kinda love it in some sort of way) and i think i am physically unable to dislike anything she does because she is my spirit animal :)\n\nalright enough of that i will not bore you with silly obsessions.\n(but i looove her. ughughugh)\n\nactually - before i reply to your message, can i say something else?\nYOU ARE DONE WITH EXAMS AREN'T YOU?!\noh no you have italian left next week you told me i think.\nBUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT (it might actually be kinda fun 'cause it's so silly illy billy)\nSO YOU'RE (basically) DONE!\nHOW DOES IT FEEL?\nHOW HAS IT BEEN?

REALLY?\nbullshit robot-producing education system. fucking madhouse i tell you! \n\nhaha i have recently come to the realisation of Dave Grohl's awesomeness too. of course he has always been but it just Clicked. that live version of Best of You you posted on tumblr is freaking incredible. DELICIOUS - i have no other word to describe the sound of his voice on that.\nand he's just such an awesome dude! (...wow that american-ness of that sentence)\n\n(i am very self-conscious of every single tumblr post i make and that is all i am going to say about that. but thank you. thank you thank you thank you you make me happy :))\n\nthis cyber connection... i need to see you. i think this not seeing you is just building up anticipation and i think i am going to be very embarrassed when i do see you. OH MY GOD WHAT IF YOU REALISE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE THE REAL BARBARA ALL THAT MUCH? haha oh my how tragic.\nwell we'd have written memories... how romantic! (jokes. jokes jokes jokes. but i think i'm actually slightly paranoid now. lol)\n\ni have loads more to say but that is all i am going to say for now because my eyes are hurting because i have been staring at the screen for too long. (i have been \"studying\" the contemporary brazilian film industry the whole afternoon - because i am going to apply for jobs and stuff... long story which i will tell you soon! but arghhh it's so scary because there is so much information to take in and the adult world is so scary and these are REAL films and cinemas and - how will i EVER be aprt of all of this? the future is fucking terrifying. btu exciting. but terrifying. the excitement actually only last a couple of seconds before i remember how scared i actually am because really i am just a child)\n\nsorry for my lack of punctuation.\nit seems to have come with this new constant state of stress/worry that i am in. everything comes out in bursts.\n\ni miss you i miss you\ni wish you were here with me or i were there with you.\nactually, i wish tele-portation existed. how perfect would that be? i'd come right now and give you a hug wherever you are as i am writing this.\ni hope you're having a nice and wonderful and enriching and enlightening and gobsmacking time wherever you are as i am writing this.\nxx\n\n",

You're so sweet really when I haven't done much except write a few painfully sappy words with an adolescent nature and touch.\nBut- I do have to say that it makes me really happy that I have been able to help you through this. Really. And don't die of embarassment- that's the type of thing that I would do and somebody wouldn't see and then I'd be like shit...but hey I saw it and it made me feel equally elated so WHAT THE HELL? :)\n \nMy exam is this afternoon for Chemistry and I have to say that I have never studied this much for an exam i don't think. I began weeks ago and have been doing major review these days and I don't get at least a four I will kill a member of the IB or maybe the Marymount staff...or perhaps just stab myself.\n\nI am actually kidding I dont mind because all the hard work will have been put in anyway so fuck that shit.\n\nlol.\n\nAnd thankyou for all the good luck wishes!! !!! !!! : ) \n\nI am listening to the Foo Fighters and I think that I am in love with Dave Grohl's voice. So powerful! The song on my tumblr....gah. I die.\nThey are really good. I don't understand why I didn't listen to them much already.\n\nYour posts, like I have told numerous times, on tumblr are so full of you. It's nice that you have been updating- another cyber source of Babi bella Babibabibabibellaaaa!\n\nXD I think it a necessity that we end up in the same city before this cyber connection takes over our lives.\n\nI think I had 1290481 things to say but I can't remember what they are and I need to review and my chest is beginning to heave.\nOne thing I hate the most about these exams is my \"before feeling\".
